## Time-Based Animated Mondrian — Individual Project

This project is my personal part. I used time-based animation to transform static compositions into dynamic works with rotation and glitch distortion effects.


## How to interact with the work

Open the page, and the animation will automatically start and continue indefinitely. The work will rotate over time, and the malfunction effect will appear rhythmically.


## Individual approach to animating

### What I Animated
**1. Time-Based Rotation**
A RotationController increases the angle every frame. This rotates the entire Mondrian composition smoothly, using methods taught in class.

**2. Time-Based Glitch Effect**
Glitch intensity changes over time and is linked to the rotation angle, creating rhythmic fluctuations.

The glitch effect was the only portion inspired by outside sources.
I adapted the concepts from p5.glitch and copy() references and re implemented them myself in a way that is compatible with the course.(***Referneces.***)


The difference between me and my team members is that I added animation to the entire image and innovated by adding Glitch effects.
